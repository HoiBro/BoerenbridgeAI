# Boerenbridge
This repository contains the code for my profielwerkstuk on Boerenbridge.

The file with the main algorithm is MCCFR.py.

The dependencies are numpy, tqdm, wandb and for the plotting experiment, matplotlib as well.

To run the experiments, use Mccfr_experiment.py, Abstraction_experiment.py or Plotting_experiment.py.
